# Awesome Miner Settings
##What is Awesome Miner?

##What is this repo about?
Importable settings for AwesomeMiner.  Don't know how to exactly create new algorithms?  Or what about settings up pools and pool groups and new algorithms?  What about different mining software?  This is a collection of different imports that will set most of that up for you.  

##How to use this repo
Most of the time you should be able to juse download and import the import file.  I would recommend that you download and view/edit the file before hand (this is just good practise for computing) to change wallets and other information if necessary.
